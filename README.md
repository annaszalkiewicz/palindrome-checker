# Is it palindrome? - Palindrome Checker
---
## Project Overview

This project is part of JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification by FreeCodeCamp. It's single page application that check if given input is palindrome. 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

## How to run project?

### Run on local machine

1. Clone repository to local machine using

```

2. Install all dependencies
```

```
3. Run application
```
$ npm start
```
visit the site: `http://localhost:3000`
You can change port by editing `package.json` file. In line 19 `"start": "react-scripts start",` add `set PORT=3000 && ` before `react-scripts start` and change port number 3000 to any other. Save file.

## Offline usage

This project use service workers and cache its content. Set up your favorite HTTP server so that a visitor to your site is served index.html, and requests to static paths like /static/js/main.<hash>.js are served with the contents of the /static/js/main.<hash>.js file. Service worker runs only on production `build` directory. If you would like to test it on your local machine, please follow this guide: 

1. Make sure you have installed [Node](https://nodejs.org/).

2. Create `build` folder
```
$ npm run build
```

3. Install [Serve](https://github.com/zeit/serve).
```
$ npm install -g serve
```
4. Serve your static site on the port 5000. 
```
$ serve -s build
```
Like many of serveâ€™s internal settings, the port can be adjusted using the `-p` or `--port` flags.

5. Open project on local server `localhost:5000`
